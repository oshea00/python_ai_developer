### Test Report for the Python Math REPL

The following tests were designed and executed to evaluate the functionality of the Python-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for simple math operations. 

#### Test Scenarios:

1. **Basic Mathematical Operations:**
   - **Input:** `3 + 5`
   - **Expect:** `8`

2. **Variable Assignment:**
   - **Input:** `result = 12 * 2`
   - **Expect:** `result = 24`

3. **Variable Usage:**
   - **Input:** `result / 3`
   - **Expect:** `8.0`

4. **Math Functions:**
   - **Input:** `math.sin(math.pi / 2)`
   - **Expect:** `1.0`

5. **Invalid Expression Handling:**
   - **Input:** `invalid expression`
   - **Expect:** Error message indicating expression cannot be evaluated.

6. **Division by Zero Handling:**
   - **Input:** `10 / 0`
   - **Expect:** Error message indicating division by zero.

7. **Exit Commands:**
   - **Input:** `exit()`
   - **Expect:** Program terminates without errors.

8. **Command-Line Calculation:**
   - **Command:** `-c "5 * math.pi"`
   - **Expect:** Result of `15.7079632679495` approximately (depending on precision settings).

#### Results:

- **Basic Operations**, **Variable Assignment and Usage**, **Math Functions**, and **Exit Commands:** All executed successfully with expected outputs.
- **Invalid Expressions** and **Division by Zero:** Raised appropriate error messages. 

- **Command-Line Argument Execution:** The expression passed was correctly evaluated and matched the expected precision.

#### Suggested Fixes:

- **Security Concern:** The use of `eval()` with user input poses a security risk. While the current implementation limits `eval()` using restricted globals, it is still recommended to parse the input using a safer method, potentially leveraging the `ast` module fully for expression evaluation.

- **Syntax Handling:** Enhance error messages by capturing syntax errors specifically, which can guide users more effectively.

The script performs well for simple calculations, math function evaluations, and the use of previous calculation results via variables. By addressing the security aspect and providing clearer error reporting, the script could be made more robust and user-friendly.
